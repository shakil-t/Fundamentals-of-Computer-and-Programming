# Fundamentals of Computer and Programming
This repository contains the codes for my first programming course as Fundamentals of Computer and Programming in 2016.\
I wrote my first program on a piece of paper. The program was supposed to print the following pattern 1000 times :\

The code printed the following pattern only once:\

To improve my programming skills, I started with basic tasks. My first challenge in this process was to write a program such that the computer guesses the number which the user has chosen in mind. This program is considered as a flex in my learning process which helped me reach a certain level of skills.\
As a final project for this course, I had to develop an ATM and calculate the Pi number with 100 precision which helped me to pass the course with highest grade.
